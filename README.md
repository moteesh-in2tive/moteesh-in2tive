Hi there,
Passionate about technology and its transformative power, I've embarked on an exhilarating journey that spans a multitude of realms within the tech landscape. My odyssey began with scripting and kernel development, gradually evolving as I embraced the dynamic landscape of microservices catalyzed by the container revolution.

My voyage has been rich and diverse, as I've navigated through an array of technologies including Python, Java, jQuery, C, Unix Kernel, Device Drivers, ZFS File System, NFS File System, Golang Microservices, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Cortex, Thanos, Cassandra, Ruby on Rails, Postgres, React, MongoDB, MySQL, Blockchain, Ethereum, Solidity, and beyond.

Having witnessed the ebb and flow of trends, I've remained at the forefront of technological evolution. I've expertly crafted both traditional and avant-garde systems, harnessing the power of Kubernetes, DevOps, and Continuous Delivery. My experience spans the spectrum from monoliths to microservices, as I've architected and engineered distributed systems that cater to the needs of Developers, DevOps professionals, and Platform Engineers, empowering them in their day-to-day undertakings.

Presently, my focus is riveted on the realm of Blockchain Technology and its burgeoning ecosystem. I'm wholeheartedly engaged in leveraging my skillset to elevate and refine the blockchain landscape. As I continue to explore and contribute to this fascinating domain, I look forward to forging new frontiers and driving innovations that leave an indelible mark on the future of technology.
